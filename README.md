# Open Cloud API

Open Cloud API is an open source project which tries to provide free APIs for internet apps to fetch public structured data (such as country list) or some common computing services (such as generating QR code).

We are releasing Open Cloud API under Apache License 2.0.

## Features of Open Cloud API

Open Cloud API is built on [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/) V2.2.1, which is a fast PHP framework with small footprint.

The features of Open Cloud API are as follow:

* All data is sent and received as JSON. This makes the APIs can be used by almost all apps (Desktop apps, Server apps, Android apps, iOS apps, Web apps, and so on).
* This project is a community-driven project. Over time, we will provide a rich set of APIs for apps.
* All APIs provided by this project (via http://api.fullstackengineer.net) are free. Any Internet apps can use the APIs.
